    question: 'What is the difference between psychiatry & therapy? Do I need both?',
    answer: (<> 
                <p>Psychiatrists are medical professionals who manage mental health 
                  disorders using medication, as they have specialized training in 
                  psychopharmacology. In addition, nurse practitioners and physician 
                  assistants are also equipped to diagnose mental health issues and 
                  prescribe appropriate medications.
                  <br /><br />
                  On the other hand, psychotherapists primarily offer talk-based therapy 
                  and generally do not have the authority to prescribe medications. They 
                  are trained in various therapeutic approaches, such as cognitive behavioral 
                  therapy, hypnosis, and others. For more information on different treatment 
                  approaches, refer to the <span><Link href="/therapy-methods" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">
                  Treatments Section,</Link></span> and explore our Therapists section to find someone who suits your needs.
                  Research shows that the most effective mental health care often involves a combination 
                  of medication and psychotherapy.</p>
